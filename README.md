Wordpress Theme Skeleton
===
Based off of `_s`: https://underscores.me

Setting Up Theme
---------------
After cloning/forking/downloading the theme, you will need to:
- manually set the theme info inside the comments at the beginning of `sass/style.scss`.
- set the correct image path to the company's logo & uncomment the block in `functions.php` => `custom_login_logo()`
- set the company's url in `functions.php` => `custom_loginlogo_url($url)`

Adjustments From `_s` Base
